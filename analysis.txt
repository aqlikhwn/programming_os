                    CLASS SCHEDULING ALGORITHM ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. ALGORITHM SELECTION
================================================================================

For class scheduling, we must use NON-PREEMPTIVE algorithms because classes 
cannot be interrupted once started. The available algorithms are:

   +------------------+-------------+--------------+
   | Algorithm        | Type        | Usable?      |
   +------------------+-------------+--------------+
   | Round-Robin      | Preemptive  | NO           |
   | SRTF             | Preemptive  | NO           |
   | SJF              | Non-Preempt | YES          |
   | Priority         | Non-Preempt | YES          |
   | FCFS             | Non-Preempt | YES          |
   +------------------+-------------+--------------+

I chose SJF (Shortest Job First - Non-Preemptive) as the comparison algorithm
because it typically provides better average waiting times than FCFS.


2. INPUT DATA
================================================================================

The following courses were used for testing:

   Course Code | Duration (hrs) | Priority | Preferred Start
   ------------|----------------|----------|----------------
   CSC2201     | 3              | 2        | 1
   CSC3401     | 2              | 3        | 2
   CSC1103     | 1              | 1        | 3


3. OUTPUT RESULTS
================================================================================

FCFS (First Come First Serve):
------------------------------
Scheduling Order: CSC2201 -> CSC3401 -> CSC1103

   Course  | Duration | Waiting Time | Turnaround Time
   --------|----------|--------------|----------------
   CSC2201 | 3        | 0            | 3
   CSC3401 | 2        | 3            | 5
   CSC1103 | 1        | 5            | 6
   --------|----------|--------------|----------------
   Average:           | 2.67 hrs     | 4.67 hrs


SJF (Shortest Job First - Non-Preemptive):
------------------------------------------
Scheduling Order: CSC1103 -> CSC3401 -> CSC2201

   Course  | Duration | Waiting Time | Turnaround Time
   --------|----------|--------------|----------------
   CSC1103 | 1        | 0            | 1
   CSC3401 | 2        | 1            | 3
   CSC2201 | 3        | 3            | 6
   --------|----------|--------------|----------------
   Average:           | 1.33 hrs     | 3.33 hrs


4. COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS
================================================================================

METRIC COMPARISON:
-----------------
   Algorithm | Avg Waiting Time | Avg Turnaround Time
   ----------|------------------|---------------------
   FCFS      | 2.67 hours       | 4.67 hours
   SJF       | 1.33 hours       | 3.33 hours

SJF IMPROVEMENT:
- Waiting Time reduced by: 50% (1.34 hours saved)
- Turnaround Time reduced by: 29% (1.34 hours saved)


5. WHY SJF IS BETTER FOR CLASS SCHEDULING
================================================================================

ADVANTAGES OF SJF:
1. MINIMIZES WAITING TIME: SJF provides the minimum average waiting time 
   among all non-preemptive algorithms. Students waiting for shorter classes
   don't have to wait for long classes to finish first.

2. BETTER RESOURCE UTILIZATION: By scheduling shorter classes first, more
   classes can be completed in a given time frame, maximizing room utilization.

3. FAIRNESS FOR SHORT CLASSES: A 1-hour class doesn't have to wait behind
   a 3-hour class just because it arrived slightly later.

DISADVANTAGES OF SJF:
1. STARVATION RISK: Long-duration classes might keep getting delayed if 
   shorter classes continuously arrive. However, since all classes are known
   upfront in our scenario, this is less of a concern.

2. IGNORES PRIORITY: SJF doesn't consider course priority. A high-priority
   course might be scheduled last if it has a long duration.


6. WHY NOT OTHER ALGORITHMS?
================================================================================

ROUND-ROBIN:
- Preemptive algorithm - cannot interrupt a class in progress
- Not suitable for class scheduling

SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First):
- Preemptive algorithm - would require stopping a class mid-lecture
- Impossible in educational settings

PRIORITY SCHEDULING:
- Also a valid choice for non-preemptive scheduling
- Could be used if course priority is more important than waiting time
- However, may result in longer average waiting times if high-priority
  courses have long durations


7. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

SJF (Shortest Job First - Non-Preemptive) is the recommended algorithm for
class scheduling because:

1. It significantly reduces average waiting time compared to FCFS
2. It is non-preemptive, respecting the constraint that classes cannot be
   interrupted
3. It provides optimal average waiting time for the given set of courses
4. It is simple to implement and understand

For this specific input, SJF reduced average waiting time by 50% compared
to FCFS, making it a clearly better choice for efficient class scheduling.
